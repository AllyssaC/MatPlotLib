                                                Pyber Analysis 

An analysis of the Pyber data allows us to draw a number of conclusions about the ride sharing company.  Based on an analysis of provided data, we can deduce the follow about the ride sharing environment:
  •	 Pyber has presence in urban, suburban, and rural areas
  •	Urban clients are much heavier users of Pyber, accounting for 63% of total fares
  •	Rural clients provide a higher average fare than both their urban and suburb counterparts
  •	Urban drivers face a higher competition among other drivers than their more rural counterparts

While competitive data would yield a much fuller look at the environment Pyber exists in, possibilities for growth in the market include:
  •	Increase in market share of rural routes
    o	Rural drivers comprise 2.6% of the drivers, while contributing 6.8% of total fares
    o	An increase in the number of drivers, might lead to a quicker response time which lends to a favorable increase in total number of         rides (currently at 5.3%)
      	As Figure 1, the Pyber Rider Sharing Bubble Plot indicates, rural routes tend to be longer, as shown through higher fare totals,           which means less availability of each driver to accept new clients
  •	Pyber should look at market saturation in a few larger cities
    o	Urban cities have a disproportionate number of drivers (81%) to the amount of revenue they contribute overall (63%), this combined         with low average fair amounts lends one to fear market saturation has set in
      	In key locations, a decrease in the amount of drivers, would increase the total revenue by driver, lending to better driver               satisfaction and less idle time
  •	An increase in response time might occur and needs to be closely monitored to not inadvertently decrease current business levels
  •	Suburban areas offer a healthy blend of number of rides (26.3%), higher average fair totals, while being serviced by fewer drivers         (16.5%) proportional to their contribution
    o	This highly profitable area should be further examined to insure this sector maximizes its market share in key suburban markets
